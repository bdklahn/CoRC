}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{number}

\item{beta}{number}

\item{kappa}{count}

\item{var}{Measurement variance, as numeric.
Can be a scalar value for variance on all measurements.
A vector for variance per dependent experimental column or all measurements individually.
A matrix for full covariance matrix.}

\item{experiments}{Object of type copasi_exp as returned by \code{\link{defineExperiments}}.
If it contains a single experiment, the values are understood to be mean values.
If it contains multiple experiments, the experiments have to have identical independent columns.}

\item{mean_fit_as_basis}{Whether to initially fit to the mean experimental data and set those fitted parameter values as starting values.
Given as flag.}

\item{cl}{Either object of type 'cluster' as used in the parallel package, or a count of threads to use, or \code{NULL} to automatically use all cores on current machine.}

\item{model}{A model object.}
}
\value{
A list of results.
\itemize{
  \item \code{$fit_task_results} is a list of all parameter estimation results gathered in this assay.
  \item \code{$sp_means} is the result of term (28).
  \item \code{$sp_cov_matrix} is the result of term (29).
  \item \code{$param_bias} is the result of term (33).
  \item \code{$param_cov_matrix} is the result of term (34).
}
}
\description{
\code{runSigmaPoint} runs parallel parameter estimations as dictated by the sigma point method and returns the results in a list.
}
\details{
WARNING: TODO: This implementation of the sigma point method is almost completely untested.

Uses the current parameter estimation settings as defined in the model, with the exception of experiments.
