Use the auto tester containers to see if CoRC is still compatible with different COPASI sources and R versions.

COPASI sources:
    Uses docker containers with recent ubuntu, gcc and R.
    Compiles COPASI from a specific branch and uses this as backend for the CoRC tests.
    Should be a good indication on whether breaking (for CoRC) changes have been introduced in the branch.
    Runs the testthat test set.
    Also has a workflow for loading all biomodels packages in sequence and checking for errors.

    test_copasi_*.sh

R-devel:
    Uses the rocker/r-devel container.
    Installs current CoRC master branch and downloads binaries.
    Should be a good indication on whether the coming R version is still binary compatible.
    Runs the testthat test set.

    test_*_with_r_devel.sh

R-var:
    Uses a docker container with recent ubuntu and all relevant R releases in /opt.
    Installs current state of CoRC (../../) and installs it with latest binaries in ../copasi-source/libs.
    Allows for testing the current state with all relevant R releases.
    Runs the testthat test set.
