Use the auto tester to see if CoRC is still compatible with the latest COPASI sources.

It uses a docker container with recent ubuntu, gcc and R.

It compiles COPASI from the latest develop HEAD and uses this as backend for the CoRC test set.
It should be a good indication on whether breaking (for CoRC) changes have been introduced in COPASI.

Run auto_tester.sh to use it.
Run auto_tester_biomodels.sh to run the additional biomodels test.
